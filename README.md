WinMonopolet is an online retail shop of alcoholic beverages, which offers a selection of wines, beer, spirits, cider and hard seltzer. The database consists of 9 tables and stores information about available products categorized by brand and type of the liquor, orders placed and customers who purchased from the store, shopping basket and accounting information.
The purpose of this project is to identify the weaknesses of the developed database and to respond to the challenges associated with them by creatin appropriate PL/SQL blocks of procedures, functions, triggers, etc.
Firstly, the order processing needs to be linked to the shopping basket check out button, so that shipping cost, taxes and bottle deposits are calculated correctly, and the product stock is up to date. For that purpose, a set of PL/SQL procedures has been compiled within the database.
Secondly, to ensure that data search and records update are handled smoothly we executed few indexes and sequences.
Lastly, triggers added to the database help with inventory tracking (by issuing corresponding message of low or high inventory) and with checking that customerâ€™s age is over 19 years old (new records insertions are limited to a certain date range).
